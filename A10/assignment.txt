1. Support chained cout statements when interpreting and compiling, including the special symbol "endl." No longer automatically print carriage returns.
2. Support += and -= style assignments.
3. Support scoping. That is, every block of code should introduce a new scope. When exiting the block, all variables declared within that block should be removed from the symbol table.
4. Make your code cross compile in Windows Visual C++, and MAC/Linux.
